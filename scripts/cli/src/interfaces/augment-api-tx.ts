       * 
       * then, it will be _put_ on chain.
       * 
       * A solution consists of two pieces of data:
       * 
       * 1. `winners`: a flat vector of all the winners of the round.
       * 2. `assignments`: the compact version of an assignment vector that encodes the edge
       * weights.
       * 
       * Both of which may be computed using _phragmen_, or any other algorithm.
       * 
       * Additionally, the submitter must provide:
       * 
       * - The `score` that they claim their solution has.
       * 
       * Both validators and nominators will be represented by indices in the solution. The
       * indices should respect the corresponding types ([`ValidatorIndex`] and
       * [`NominatorIndex`]). Moreover, they should be valid when used to index into
       * [`SnapshotValidators`] and [`SnapshotNominators`]. Any invalid index will cause the
       * solution to be rejected. These two storage items are set during the election window and
       * may be used to determine the indices.
       * 
       * A solution is valid if:
       * 
       * 0. It is submitted when [`EraElectionStatus`] is `Open`.
       * 1. Its claimed score is equal to the score computed on-chain.
       * 2. Presents the correct number of winners.
       * 3. All indexes must be value according to the snapshot vectors. All edge values must
       * also be correct and should not overflow the granularity of the ratio type (i.e. 256
       * or billion).
       * 4. For each edge, all targets are actually nominated by the voter.
       * 5. Has correct self-votes.
       * 
       * A solutions score is consisted of 3 parameters:
       * 
       * 1. `min { support.total }` for each support of a winner. This value should be maximized.
       * 2. `sum { support.total }` for each support of a winner. This value should be minimized.
       * 3. `sum { support.total^2 }` for each support of a winner. This value should be
       * minimized (to ensure less variance)
