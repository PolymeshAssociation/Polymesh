//! # Checkpoint Module
//!
//! The Checkpoint module provides extrinsics and storage to take snapshots,
//! henceforth called *checkpoints*, of the supply of assets,
//! and how they were distributed at the time of checkpoint.
//!
//! Using the module, users can also schedule checkpoints in the future,
//! either at fixed points in time (e.g., "next friday"),
//! or at regular intervals (e.g., "every month").
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! - `create_checkpoint` creates a checkpoint.
//! - `set_schedules_max_complexity` sets the max total complexity of a ticker's schedule set.
//! - `create_schedule` creates a checkpoint schedule.
//! - `remove_schedule` removes a checkpoint schedule.
//!
//! ### Public Functions
//!
//! - `balance_at(ticker, did, cp)` returns the balance of `did` for `ticker` at least `>= cp`.
//! - `advance_update_balances(ticker, updates)` advances schedules for `ticker`
//!    and applies new balances in `updates` for the last checkpoint.
//! - Other misc storage items as defined in `decl_storage!`.
