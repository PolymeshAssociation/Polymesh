//! # Contracts Module
//!
//! The contracts module provides the Layer 2 solution for Polymesh.
//! These smart contracts are defined using WASM,
//! and facilitated by the `ink!` DSL provided by Parity.
//!
//! With this module, you or Alice can instantiate such a contract,
//! through `instantiate_with_code` or `instantiate_with_hash`,
//! attaching its key as a secondary key of the signer's identity.
//! Anyone can then call this smart contract, e.g., Bob,
//! which may call back into the runtime to e.g., `create_asset`.
//! However, during the execution of `create_asset`,
//! the current identity will be Alice, as opposed to `Bob`.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Contracts module provides functions for:
//!
//! - Instantiating contracts
//! - Calling contracts
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! - `instantiate_with_code` instantiates a contract with the code provided.
//! - `instantiate_with_hash` instantiates a contract by hash,
//!   assuming that a contract with the same code already was uploaded.
//! - `call` dispatches to the smart contract code, acting as the identity who made the contract.
