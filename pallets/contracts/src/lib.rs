//! # Contracts Module
//!
//! The contracts module provides the Layer 2 solution for Polymesh.
//! These smart contracts are defined using WASM,
//! and facilitated by the `ink!` DSL provided by Parity.
//!
//! With this module, you or Alice can instantiate such a contract,
//! through `instantiate_with_code` or `instantiate_with_hash`,
//! attaching its key as a secondary key of the signer's identity.
//! Anyone can then call this smart contract, e.g., Bob,
//! which may call back into the runtime to e.g., `create_asset`.
//! However, during the execution of `create_asset`,
//! the current identity will be Alice, as opposed to `Bob`.
//!
//! Transaction fees for calling into the runtime are charged to the gas meter
//! of the contract.  Protocol fees are charged to the contract's address, the contract
//! can require the caller to pay these fees by making the call payable and require
//! enough POLYX is transferred to cover the protocol fees.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The PolymeshContracts module provides functions for:
//!
//! - Instantiating contracts with custom permissions.
//!
//! Use the standard Substrate `pallet_contracts` to instantiate, call, upload_code, or remove_code.
//! That interface is compatible with the Polkadot.js Contracts UI.
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! - `instantiate_with_code_perms` instantiates a contract with the code provided.
//!   The contract's address will be added as a secondary key with the provided permissions.
//! - `instantiate_with_hash_perms` instantiates a contract by hash,
//!   assuming that a contract with the same code already was uploaded.
//!   The contract's address will be added as a secondary key with the provided permissions.
