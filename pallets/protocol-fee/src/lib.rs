//! # Protocol Fee Module
//!
//! This module stores the fee of each protocol operation, and a common coefficient which is applied on
//! fee computation.
//!
//! It also provides helper functions to calculate and charge fees on each protocol operation.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! - [change_coefficient](Module::change_coefficient) - It changes the fee coefficient.
//! - [change_base_fee](Module::change_base_fee) - It changes the base fee.
//!
//! ### Public Functions
//!
//! - [compute_fee](Module::compute_fee) - It computes the fee of the operation.
//! - [charge_fee](Module::charge_fee) - It calculates the fee and charges it.
//! - [batch_charge_fee](Module::batch_charge_fee) - It calculates the fee and charges it on a batch operation.
//!
