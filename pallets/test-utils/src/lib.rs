//! # Testnet module
//!
//! This module contains helpers or mocked functionality.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Testnet pallet is used to cover functionality that is not yet implemented or required external
//! entities to carry on some processes.
//! The main idea is that it mocks that functionality and allow generating development or testnet
//! networks.
//!
//! ### DID generation and CDD claims.
//!
//! DID generation requires a CDD service provider involved in the process. In this module, you can
//! find some extrinsics allow to generate those DID by yourself.
//!
//! ### Getting information using events.
//!
//! It also contains some extrinsics to generate events containing specific information. Those
//! events are used in web application to extract easily information from the chain.
//!
//! ## Dispatchable Functions.
//!
//! - `register_did` - Register a new did with a CDD claim for the caller.
//! - `cdd_register_did` - Registers a new did for the target and attaches a CDD claim to it.
//! - `get_my_did` - Generates an event containing the DID of the caller.
//! - `get_cdd_of` -> Generates an event containing the CDD claim of the target account.
