// Modified by Polymesh Association - 23rd March 2020
// Polymesh changes - This module is inspired from the `pallet-collective`
// https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/substrate/tree/a439a7aa5a9a3df2a42d9b25ea04288d3a0866e8/frame/collective
// It is modified as per the requirement of the Polymesh
// -`set_members()` dispatchable get removed and members are maintained by the group module
// - New instance of the group module is being added and assigned committee instance to
// `MembershipInitialized` & `MembershipChanged` trait

//! # Committee Module
//!
//! The Committee module is used to create a committee of members who vote and ratify proposals.
//! This was based on Substrate's `pallet-collective` but this module differs in the following way:
//! - The winning proposal is determined by a vote threshold which is set at genesis.
//! - The vote threshold can be modified per instance.
//! - The members are DIDs.
//!
//! ## Overview
//! The module allows to control of membership of a set of
//! [`IdentityId`](../../primitives/struct.IdentityId.html)s, which includes:
//! - changing the members of the committee,
//! - allowing the members to propose a dispatchable,
//! - allowing the members to vote on a proposal,
//! - automatically dispatching a proposal if it meets a vote threshold.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//! - `vote_or_propose` - Members can propose a new dispatchable.
//! - `vote` - Members vote on proposals which are automatically dispatched if they meet vote threshold.
//! - `close` - May be called by any signed account after the voting duration has ended in order to
//! finish voting and close the proposal.
//! - `set_vote_threshold` - Changes the threshold for a committee majority.
//! - `set_release_coordinator` - Changes the release coordinator.
//! - `set_expires_after` - Sets the time after which a proposal expires.
//!
//! ### Other Public Functions
//! - `is_member` - Returns true if a given DID is contained in the set of committee members, and
//! `false` otherwise.
