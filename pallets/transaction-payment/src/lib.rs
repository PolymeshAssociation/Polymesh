// - Charge fee from the identity in the signed extension
// - Introduce `ChargeTxFee` trait to compute and charge transaction fee for Multisig.

//! # Transaction Payment Module
//!
//! This module provides the basic logic needed to pay the absolute minimum amount needed for a
//! transaction to be included. This includes:
//!   - _weight fee_: A fee proportional to amount of weight a transaction consumes.
//!   - _length fee_: A fee proportional to the encoded length of the transaction.
//!   - _tip_: An optional tip. Tip increases the priority of the transaction, giving it a higher
//!     chance to be included by the transaction queue.
//!
//! Additionally, this module allows one to configure:
//!   - The mapping between one unit of weight to one unit of fee via [`WeightToFee`].
//!   - A means of updating the fee for the next block, via defining a multiplier, based on the
//!     final state of the chain at the end of the previous block. This can be configured via
//!     [`FeeMultiplierUpdate`]

/// must provide the minimum allowed value for the multiplier. Note that a runtime should ensure
/// with tests that the combination of this `M` and `V` is not such that the multiplier can drop to
/// zero and never recover.
///
/// note that `s'` is interpreted as a portion in the _normal transaction_ capacity of the block.
/// For example, given `s' == 0.25` and `AvailableBlockRatio = 0.75`, then the target fullness is
/// _0.25 of the normal capacity_ and _0.1875 of the entire block_.
///
/// This implementation implies the bound:
/// - `v ≤ p / k * (s − s')`
/// - or, solving for `p`: `p >= v * k * (s - s')`
///
/// where `p` is the amount of change over `k` blocks.
///
/// Hence:
/// - in a fully congested chain: `p >= v * k * (1 - s')`.
/// - in an empty chain: `p >= v * k * (-s')`.
///
/// For example, when all blocks are full and there are 28800 blocks per day (default in `substrate-node`)
/// and v == 0.00001, s' == 0.1875, we'd have:
///
/// p >= 0.00001 * 28800 * 0.8125
/// p >= 0.234
///
/// Meaning that fees can change by around ~23% per day, given extreme congestion.
