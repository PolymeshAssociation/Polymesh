//! # Settlement Module
//!
//! Settlement module manages all kinds of transfers and settlements of assets
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The settlement module provides functionality to settle onchain as well as offchain trades between multiple parties.
//! All trades are settled under venues. A token issuer can allow/block certain venues from settling trades that involve their tokens.
//! An atomic settlement is called an Instruction. An instruction can contain multiple legs. Legs are essentially simple one to one transfers.
//! When an instruction is settled, either all legs are executed successfully or none are. In other words, if one of the leg fails due to
//! compliance failure, all other legs will also fail.
//!
//! An instruction must be authorized by all the counter parties involved for it to be executed.
//! An instruction can be set to automatically execute in the next block when all authorizations are received or at a particular block number.
//!
//! Offchain settlements are represented via receipts. If a leg has a receipt attached to it, it will not be executed onchain.
//! All other legs will be executed onchain during settlement.
//!
//! ## Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! - `create_venue` - Registers a new venue.
//! - `add_instruction` - Adds a new instruction.
//! - `affirm_instruction` - Provides affirmation to an existing instruction.
//! - `withdraw_affirmation` - Withdraw an existing affirmation to given instruction.
//! - `reject_instruction` - Rejects an existing instruction.
//! - `claim_receipt` - Claims a signed receipt.
//! - `unclaim_receipt` - Unclaims a previously claimed receipt.
//! - `set_venue_filtering` - Enables or disabled venue filtering for a token.
//! - `allow_venues` - Allows additional venues to create instructions involving an asset.
//! - `disallow_venues` - Revokes permission given to venues for creating instructions involving a particular asset.
//!
