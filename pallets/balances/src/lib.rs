// any migration data structure.

//! # Balances Module
//!
//! The Balances module provides functionality for handling accounts and balances.
//!
//! - [`balances::Trait`](./trait.Trait.html)
//! - [`Call`](./enum.Call.html)
//! - [`Module`](./struct.Module.html)
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This is a modified implementation of substrate's balances FRAME.
//! The modifications made are as follows:
//!
//! - To curb front running, sending a tip along with your transaction is now prohibited.
//! - Added From<u128> trait to Balances type.
//! - Removed existential amount requirement to prevent a replay attack scenario.
//! - Added block rewards reserve that subsidize minting for block rewards.
//! - Added CDD check for POLYX recipients.
//! - Added ability to attach a memo with a transfer.
//! - Added ability to burn your tokens.
//!
//! The Original Balances module provides functions for:
//!
//! - Getting and setting free balances.
//! - Retrieving total, reserved and unreserved balances.
//! - Repatriating a reserved balance to a beneficiary account that exists.
//! - Transferring a balance between accounts (when not reserved).
//! - Slashing an account balance.
//! - Account creation and removal.
//! - Managing total issuance.
//! - Setting and managing locks.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! - **Total Issuance:** The total number of units in existence in a system.
//! - **Reaping an account:** The act of removing an account by resetting its nonce. Happens after its balance is set
//! to zero.
//! - **Free Balance:** The portion of a balance that is not reserved. The free balance is the only balance that matters
//! for most operations.
//! - **Reserved Balance:** Reserved balance still belongs to the account holder, but is suspended. Reserved balance
//! can still be slashed, but only after all the free balance has been slashed.
//! - **Imbalance:** A condition when some funds were credited or debited without equal and opposite accounting
//! (i.e. a difference between total issuance and account balances). Functions that result in an imbalance will
//! return an object of the `Imbalance` trait that can be managed within your runtime logic. (If an imbalance is
//! simply dropped, it should automatically maintain any book-keeping such as total issuance.)
//! - **Lock:** A freeze on a specified amount of an account's free balance until a specified block number. Multiple
//! locks always operate over the same funds, so they "overlay" rather than "stack".
//! - **Vesting:** Similar to a lock, this is another, but independent, liquidity restriction that reduces linearly
//! over time.
//!
//! ### Implementations
//!
//! The Balances module provides implementations for the following traits. If these traits provide the functionality
//! that you need, then you can avoid coupling with the Balances module.
//!
//! - [`Currency`](../frame_support/traits/trait.Currency.html): Functions for dealing with a
//! fungible assets system.
//! - [`ReservableCurrency`](../frame_support/traits/trait.ReservableCurrency.html):
//! Functions for dealing with assets that can be reserved from an account.
//! - [`LockableCurrency`](../frame_support/traits/trait.LockableCurrency.html): Functions for
//! dealing with accounts that allow liquidity restrictions.
//! - [`Imbalance`](../frame_support/traits/trait.Imbalance.html): Functions for handling
//! imbalances between total issuance in the system and account balances. Must be used when a function
//! creates new funds (e.g. a reward) or destroys some funds (e.g. a system fee).
//! - [`IsDeadAccount`](../srml_system/trait.IsDeadAccount.html): Determiner to say whether a
//! given account is unused.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! - `transfer` - Transfer some liquid free balance to another account.
//! - `transfer_with_memo` - Transfer some liquid free balance to another account alon with a memo.
//! - `set_balance` - Set the balances of a given account. The origin of this call must be root.
//! - `deposit_block_reward_reserve_balance` - Transfer some liquid free balance to block rewards reserve.
//! - `force_transfer` - Force transfer some balance from one account to another. The origin of this call must be root.
//! - `burn_account_balance` - Burn some liquid free balance.

//! ### Public Functions
//!
//! - `free_balance` - Get the free balance of an account.
//! - `usable_balance` - Get the balance of an account that can be used for transfers, reservations, or any other non-locking, non-transaction-fee activity.
//! - `usable_balance_for_fees` - Get the balance of an account that can be used for paying transaction fees (not tipping, or any other kind of fees, though).
//! - `reserved_balance` - Get the reserved balance of an account.
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The following examples show how to use the Balances module in your custom module.
//!
//! ### Examples from the FRAME
//!
//! The Contract module uses the `Currency` trait to handle gas payment, and its types inherit from `Currency`:
//!
//! ```
//! use frame_support::traits::Currency;
//! # pub trait Trait: frame_system::Trait {
//! # type Currency: Currency<Self::AccountId>;
//! # }
//!
//! pub type BalanceOf<T> = <<T as Trait>::Currency as Currency<<T as frame_system::Trait>::AccountId>>::Balance;
//! pub type NegativeImbalanceOf<T> = <<T as Trait>::Currency as Currency<<T as frame_system::Trait>::AccountId>>::NegativeImbalance;
//!
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! The Staking module uses the `LockableCurrency` trait to lock a stash account's funds:
//!
//! ```
//! use frame_support::traits::{WithdrawReasons, LockableCurrency};
//! use sp_runtime::traits::Bounded;
//! pub trait Trait: frame_system::Trait {
//! type Currency: LockableCurrency<Self::AccountId, Moment=Self::BlockNumber>;
//! }
//! # struct StakingLedger<T: Trait> {
//!     # stash: <T as frame_system::Trait>::AccountId,
//!     # total: <<T as Trait>::Currency as frame_support::traits::Currency<<T as frame_system::Trait>::AccountId>>::Balance,
//!     # phantom: std::marker::PhantomData<T>,
//! # }
//! # const STAKING_ID: [u8; 8] = *b"staking ";
//!
//! fn update_ledger<T: Trait>(
//!     controller: &T::AccountId,
//!     ledger: &StakingLedger<T>
//! ) {
//!     T::Currency::set_lock(
//!         STAKING_ID,
//!         &ledger.stash,
//!         ledger.total,
//!         WithdrawReasons::all()
//!     );
//!     // <Ledger<T>>::insert(controller, ledger); // Commented out as we don't have access to Staking's storage here.
//! }
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! ## Genesis config
//!
//! The Balances module depends on the [`GenesisConfig`](./struct.GenesisConfig.html).
//!
//! ## Assumptions
//!
//! * Total issued balanced of all accounts should be less than `Trait::Balance::max_value()`.

// TODO: Because of Polymesh custom changes upstream weight calculation get affected to get the right figures
// need to benchmark the module by keeping custom changes in mind. Specifically CDD check.
