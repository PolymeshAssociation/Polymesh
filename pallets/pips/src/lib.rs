//! # Pips Module
//!
//! Polymesh Improvement Proposals (PIPs) are dispatchables that can be `propose`d for execution.
//! These PIPs can either be proposed by a committee, or they can be proposed by a community member,
//! in which case they can `vote`d on by all POLYX token holders.
//!
//! Voting, or rather "signalling", which currently scales linearly with POLX,
//! in this system is used to direct the Governance Councils (GCs)
//! attention by moving proposals up and down a review queue, specific to community proposals.
//!
//! From time to time, the GC will take a `snapshot` of this queue,
//! meet and review PIPs, and reject, approve, or skip the proposal (via `enact_snapshot_results`).
//! Any approved PIPs from this snapshot will then be scheduled,
//! in order of signal value, to be executed automatically on the blockchain.
//! However, using `reschedule_proposal`, a special Release Coordinator (RC), a member of the GC,
//! can reschedule approved PIPs at will, except for a PIP to replace the RC.
//! Once no longer relevant, the snapshot can be cleared by the GC through `clear_snapshot`.
//!
//! As aforementioned, the GC can skip a PIP, which will increments its "skipped count".
//! Should a configurable limit for the skipped count be exceeded, a PIP can no longer be skipped.
//!
//! Committee proposals, as noted before, do not enter the snapshot or receive votes.
//! However, the GC can at any moment approve such a PIP via `approve_committee_proposal`.
//!
//! Should the GC want to reject an active (scheduled or pending) proposal,
//! they can do so at any time using `reject_proposal`.
//! For garbage collection purposes, it is also possible to use `prune_proposal`,
//! which will, without any restrictions on its state, remove the PIP's storage.
//!
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Pips module provides functions for:
//!
//! - Proposing and amending PIPs
//! - Signalling (voting) on them for adjusting priority in the review queue
//! - Taking and clearing snapshots of the queue
//! - Approving, rejecting, skipping, and rescheduling PIPs
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! #### Configuration changes
//!
//! - `set_prune_historical_pips` change whether historical PIPs are pruned
//! - `set_min_proposal_deposit` change min deposit to create a proposal
//! - `set_default_enactment_period` change the period after enactment after which the proposal is executed
//! - `set_max_pip_skip_count` change the maximum times a PIP can be skipped
//! - `set_active_pip_limit` change the maximum number of concurrently active PIPs
//!
//! #### Other
//!
//! - `propose` - token holders can propose a new PIP.
//! - `amend_proposal` - allows the creator of a proposal to amend the proposal details
//! - `cancel_proposal` - allows the creator of a proposal to cancel the proposal
//! - `vote` - token holders, including the PIP's proposer, can vote on a PIP.
//! - `approve_committee_proposal` - allows the GC to approve a committee proposal
//! - `reject_proposal` - reject an active proposal and refund deposits
//! - `prune_proposal` - prune all storage associated with proposal and refund deposits
//! - `reschedule_execution` - release coordinator can reschedule a PIPs execution
//! - `clear_snapshot` - clears the snapshot
//! - `snapshot` - takes a new snapshot of the review queue
//! - `enact_snapshot_results` - enters results (approve, reject, and skip) for PIPs in snapshot
//!
//! ### Public Functions
//!
//! - `end_block` - executes scheduled proposals
