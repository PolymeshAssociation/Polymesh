//! # Capital Distribution Module
//!
//! The capital distributions module provides functionality for distributing benefits,
//! whether predictable, or unpredictable, to tokenholders.
//!
//! The process works by first initiating the corporate action (CA) through `initiate_corporate_action`,
//! and then attaching a capital distribution to it via `distribute`.
//!
//! When attaching a distribution, the portfolio to withdraw from is provided,
//! as is the currency and amount of it to withdraw from the portfolio.
//! Additionally, a date (`payment_at`) is provided at which withdrawals may first happen,
//! as well as an optional expiry date `expires_at`,
//! at which benefits are forfeit and may be reclaimed by the CAA.
//!
//! As aforementioned, once `payment_at` is due, benefits may be withdrawn.
//! This can be done either through `claim`, which is pull-based. That is, holders withdraw themselves.
//! The other mechanism is via `push_benefit`, which with the CAA can push to a holder.
//! Once `expires_at` is reached, however, the remaining amount to distribute is forfeit,
//! and cannot be claimed by any holder, or pushed to them.
//! Instead, that amount can be reclaimed by the CAA.
//!
//! Before `payment_at` is due, however,
//! a planned distribution can be cancelled by calling `remove_distribution`.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The module provides functions for:
//!
//! - Starting a distribution.
//! - Claiming or pushing benefits of a distribution.
//! - Reclaiming unclaimed dividends.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! - **Currency:** The ticker being distributed to holders as a benefit, e.g., USDC or some such.
//! - **Payment-at date:** The date at which benefits may be claimed by or pushed to holders.
//! - **Expires-at date:** The date at which benefits are forfeit, and may be reclaimed by the CAA.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! - `distribute` starts a capital distribution.
//! - `claim` claims (pull) a benefit of an active capital distribution on behalf of a holder.
//! - `push_benefit` pushes a benefit of an active capital distribution to a holder.
//! - `reclaim` reclaims forfeited benefits of a capital distribution that has expired.
//! - `remove_distribution` removes a capital distribution which hasn't reached its payment date yet.
